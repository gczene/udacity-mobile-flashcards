# Udacity mobile flash cards app

## To install 

run:
```
yarn
``` 
and in /ios directory run 
```
pod install
```

## Environment
I could work only on IOS device + simulator, but should work in android emulator too. I was facing some issues after implementing notifications. Namely, after that, it was running only inside **expo**.
